# PEPRMT-Hydrofocus
R Code for running the PEPRMT model in its newer tidal wetland version
Open R project file under Eden Landing MEM PEPRMT example folder
This loads and runs MEM at the beginning just to get a value for the initial SOC pool
But you can skip that whole first part of the code and simple input a measured value from your site
